What are different sorting algorithms?
There are more than 28 types of sorting algorithms. Let's check out the major ones asked in interviews.

What are the characteristics of sorting algorithms?
1. time complexity
2. space complexity
3. stability
4. does it use comparison sort?
5. parallelism
6. Adaptability
7. Recursion

Out of these, time and space complexity are the most important characteristics


Most common sorting algorithms:

    simple sorting algorithms:
        1. bubble sort :
                it is one of the simplest sorting algorithms
                it repeatedly swaps the adjacent elements till they are completely sorted
                time complexity:
                    best case: O(n)
                    avg case: O(n^2)
                    worst case: O(n^2)
                space complexity:
                    O(1)


        2. selection sort
                it divides the list into 2 sublist and sorts the sublist
                time complexity:
                    best case: O(n^2)
                    avg case: O(n^2)
                    worst case: O(n^2)
                space complexity:
                    O(1)


        3. insertion sort
                this is a fuckall algorithm which was made just for the sake of it
                someone saw other people building
                time complexity:
                    best case: O(n)
                    worst case: O(n^2)




    efficient sorting algorithms:
        1. merge sort
        2. heap sort
        3. quick sort

    non-comparison sorting algorithms:
        1. counting sort
        2. radix sort
        3. bucket sort
