How to identify a binary search problem?
    If the array is sorted and you have to optimise the solution further, then you can consider binary search

Parent problems in DP:
    1. Binary search
    2. order agnostic BS
    3. 1st and last occurrence of an element
    4. count of element in a sorted array
    5. no of times an array is rotated
    6. find an element in a rotated sorted array
    7. searching in a nearly sorted array
    8. float/ceil of an element
    9. next letter
    10. index of last 1 in sorted array
    11. find the position of an element in an infinitely sorted array
    12. min diff ele in a sorted array
    13. Bitonic array max element
    14. search in bitonic array
    15. search in row wise column wise sorted matrix
    16. Find element in sorted array that appears only once
    17. allocate min number of pages
