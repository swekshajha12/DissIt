Intuition: Repetitive work along a fixed window in an array or string
Identification: Window is not gonna break, it will be continuous
                Would be subarray/substring type of question
                Would be asking something largest or something
                There would be some window value given in input, say k
                or would ask to find the window size

Types:
        1. Fixed size window : window size is given, find some value
                                e.g: Given a window x, find the window with the largest sum
        2. Variable size window : window size won't be given, you have to find the window
                                  largest or smallest window subjected to some condition
                                  e.g: Given sum x, find the largest substring which has sum 5
